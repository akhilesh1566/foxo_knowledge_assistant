# Autogen Knowledge Assistant - Local Retrieval AI Agent

## Overview

The Autogen Knowledge Assistant is a AI agent designed to answer questions using internal company documents (PDFs, md and txt) and external tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for document-based queries and can also perform calculations and web searches. The agent is built using Python, AutoGen for multi-agent orchestration, LangChain for RAG components, and Streamlit for a simple web interface.

## Setup Instructions

1. Prerequisites
*   Python 3.9 or higher (developed and tested with Python 3.11.8).
*   Git.

2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git https://github.com/akhilesh1566/foxo_knowledge_assistant.git
cd foxo_knowledge_assistant

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate depends on your OS:
# Windows (Git Bash or PowerShell):
source venv/Scripts/activate
# macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Configure Environment Variables (API Keys)
You will need API keys for OpenAI, Google (Gemini), and Tavily.

Create a .env file:
Copy the .env.example file to a new file named .env in the project root:
cp .env.example .env

Edit .env and add your API keys:
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your_openai_api_key_here"
GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIzaSyYour_google_api_key_here" 
TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-your_tavily_api_key_here"

6. Prepare Documents for Ingestion
Place your PDF documents (at least 3 sample files are recommended for good testing) into the data/ directory in the project root.

7. Run the Application & Ingest Documents
Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py




Tools Used & Rationale:


AutoGen: Chosen for its powerful multi-agent capabilities, allowing for sophisticated tool orchestration and the creation of specialized agents. It handles the OpenAI function calling flow for tool selection effectively.
LangChain: Utilized for its robust RAG pipeline components:
Document loaders and text splitters for processing PDFs.
Integrations for Google Gemini embeddings (GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings).
ChromaDB vector store wrapper for easy interaction.
Prompt templates and LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) for constructing the RAG chain used by the internal knowledge base tool.
TavilySearchResults wrapper for quick web search integration.
OpenAI GPT Models: Used as the LLM for the primary AssistantAgent in AutoGen due to strong reasoning, instruction following, and reliable function calling capabilities.
Google Gemini Models:
models/embedding-001: For generating high-quality text embeddings for document chunks.
gemini-1.0-pro-latest (or similar): Used as the LLM within the RAG tool to synthesize answers specifically from the retrieved document context. This decouples the RAG answer synthesis from the main assistant's LLM.
ChromaDB: Selected as a simple, local, and open-source vector database, suitable for POCs and easy setup.
PyMuPDF: A fast and efficient library for PDF text and metadata extraction.
Streamlit: Chosen for its ability to quickly create interactive and user-friendly Python web applications with minimal front-end code.
Tavily API: Provides a simple and effective search API with a generous free tier, ideal for adding web search capabilities to a POC.

Agent Functioning:
Assistant decides to call a function, its message to UserProxy includes function_call.
UserProxy sees function_call, executes the function from function_map.
UserProxy sends a message with role function (or tool) containing the result back to Assistant.
Assistant uses this result to generate its final response.


Sample Questions & Responses:


1. Querying Internal Documents (RAG Tool):

KnowledgeExplorerAssistant: Hello! I am the Autogen Multi-Tool Assistant. I can search documents or perform calculations. How can I help?

User: when Third Party and Outsourcing Services Contract shall be awarded?

UserProxy: when Third Party and Outsourcing Services Contract shall be awarded?

assistant: üõ†Ô∏è Calling tool: query_internal_knowledge_base Arguments:

{
"query": "When shall Third Party and Outsourcing Services Contract be awarded?"
}

‚öôÔ∏è Result from query_internal_knowledge_base:

Answer: Any Third Party and Outsourcing Services Contract shall be awarded after completion of the Vendor Evaluation and Selection process.

KnowledgeExplorerAssistant: The Third Party and Outsourcing Services Contract shall be awarded after completion of the Vendor Evaluation and Selection process.



2. Using the Calculator Tool:

User: What is (150 / 3) + 25 * 2?

UserProxy: What is (150 / 3) + 25 * 2?

assistant: üõ†Ô∏è Calling tool: simple_calculator Arguments:

{
"expression": "(150 / 3) + 25 * 2"
}

‚öôÔ∏è Result from simple_calculator:

The result of '(150 / 3) + 25 * 2' is 100.0.



3. Using the Web Search Tool:

User: What is the latest news about renewable energy in Europe?

UserProxy: What is the latest news about renewable energy in Europe?

assistant: üõ†Ô∏è Calling tool: perform_web_search Arguments:

{
"query": "latest news about renewable energy in Europe"
}
